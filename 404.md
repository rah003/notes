# How to configure multiple custom 404 pages in Magnolia Cloud

Magnolia Cloud comes w/ preconfigured 404 page pointing to `/docroot/404.html`. 
Unless you have Cloud 3 option selected, you are not able to change this location. 
And even if you can change it, you might still need some of what is described below if you want to have different 404 page 
for each separate site you handle in your cloud installation or for each different language you have in your installation.

## Step one, make page editable
The default location (`/docroot/404.html`) is likely just leftover from old times when you ran Magnolia onprem and could mess 
around with the webapp. At the time, location made sense since the page would be served even if you totally messed up your app
by e.g. breaking filter chain at runtime. However in the cloud it simply doesn't make sense for you. You can't edit the page 
as there's no filesystem you could play with.  
So what you want is turn this location into normal Magnolia page.  
To do so, we need to tell Magnolia that it can't any longer ignore what's in `/docroot` subpath of the URI.
* Open *Configuration* app from AdminCentral, navigate to `/server/filters/cms/bypasses/docroot` and delete the path
* By this step, you will disable serving of default `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` so if you want to keep those 
files (and make them editable for yourself), still in the *Configuration* app, go to `/server/webContainerResources/mappings/docroot` and
change its value from `/docroot/*` to `/modules/light-modules/docroot/*`. With this change you can place new, custom `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico` 
and `sitemap.xml` in your light modules repository (under the `/docroot` folder) and have them served by Magnolia even in Cloud 1.
* In theory, if all you require is just single 404 page for all the sites and all the languages you handle and you don't need it to be dynamic, 
you can place 404.html at the same place in light modules and your work is done.
## Step two, make your 404 page site-aware
Assuming you do have multiple sites and want to make 404 page different for each of them to deliver better user experience, 
you need to define *Virtual URI Mapping* (sometimes also refered to as *redirect* in Magnolia documentation).  
* in the `/light-modules/[my-module]/virtualURIMappings/doc_root` folder create file `404.yaml` with following content:
```
class: info.magnolia.virtualuri.mapping.DefaultVirtualUriMapping
fromUri: /docroot/404.html
toUri: forward:/404.html
```
with this we are telling Magnolia, when looking for `/docroot/404.html` (the default (and only) configuration for Cloud 1) to 
look at 404 *page* in whatever site it is in which the 404 occured. This means that instead of having ONE 404 site, we will 
have one such page per site.
* Next step would be to create 404 page for each site, but before we can do that, we need to create template for such page.
* Create a template file, might look like this one:
```
[#-- fn to figure our regional sub-sites --]
[#function getRegion siteUrl]
  [#assign regions = ['/brasil/', '/china/', '/colombia/', '/japan/', '/korea/', '/mexico/']]

  [#list regions as region]
    [#if siteUrl?contains(region)]
      [#return region]
    [/#if]
  [/#list]

  [#return '']
[/#function]

[#-- some vars to facilitate decision making on which language and navigation to serve later --]
[#assign isSite_A404 = content.@path?starts_with('/site_a')]
[#assign isSite_B404 = content.@path?starts_with('/site_b')]
[#assign isSite_C404 = content.@path?starts_with('/site_c')]
[#assign siteUrl = state.originalBrowserURL!]
[#assign isEnglish = siteUrl?contains('/en/')]
[#assign region = getRegion(siteUrl)]

[#if (isSite_A404 || isSite_B404)]
    [#if region?has_content && isEnglish]
        ${ctx.response.sendRedirect('/en' + region + '404.html')}
    [#elseif region?has_content]
        ${ctx.response.sendRedirect(region +  '404.html')}
    [/#if]
[#elseif isSite_C404 && cmsfn.language() != 'en' && isEnglish]
    ${ctx.response.sendRedirect('/en/404.html')}
[/#if]

    <div class="site-content" id="main-content" role="main">
        <h1 class="visuallyhidden">${i18n["pages.404.h1"]}</h1>
        <section class="ErrorMessage">
            <div class="ErrorMessage--inner">
                <div class="SectionContainer">
                    <div class="SectionTitle">


                    [#assign parent = cmsfn.parent(content, "mgnl:page")! ]

                        <h2 class="SectionTitle--title">${i18n["pages.404.title"]}
                        </h2>
                        <p class="SectionTitle--headline">
                            ${i18n["pages.404.headline"]}
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="ErrorMessage--content">
                        ${i18n["pages.404.content"]}
                    </p>

                    <div class="SectionContainer--footer">
                        <a class="Button transparent" href="${cmsfn.link(siteRoot!)}">
                            <span class="Button--content">
                            ${i18n["pages.404.backLink"]}
                            </span>
                        </a>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="ErrorMessage--background">
                <div class="Media image" style="background-image:url('/.resources/my-module/webresources/img/404/404_resized.jpg')">
                    <div data-sizes="/.resources/my-module/webresources/img/404/404_resized.jpg 3200x1200" style="background-image:url('/.resources/my-module/webresources/img/404/404_resized.jpg')">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
    </div>
</div>
[#include "../areas/htmlFooter.ftl"]
</body>
</html>
```
* Create a template definition like this (I've included navigation in there because I want one, but of course you are free 
to not do so):
```
title: 'Unique: 404'
templateScript: /my-module/templates/pages/404.ftl
renderType: freemarker
visible: true
type: home
class: info.magnolia.rendering.template.configured.ConfiguredTemplateDefinition
areas:
  navigation: !include:/my-module/includes/templates/navigationAreaWithTeaser.yaml
```
* Open *Pages* app, go to each of your site trees and create page called `404` under each tree with template `Unique: 404` assigned to it.

As you can see, template is defined as `home` type templace so that you can use it high up in the hierarchy. Also I've 
included navigation in there and have some properties defined for the page as expected and used in the page itself. You 
are of course free to change all of that. It will have no impact on the ability to provide custom 404 pages.  

Once everything is done and over with, don't forget to publish all the changes in *Configuration* app and all new 404 pages 
in *Pages* app. And then test that it all works.
